This small program was made (by me) to assist me in summer work. I was scanning archive of some company. Instead of scanning every document individually, I was putting more of them at once, but separated with all red (any colour) piece of paper. Program was parting big PDF document with all document grouped into small one document PDF. Additionally, It looked for empty pages and removed them.
